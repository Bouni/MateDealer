MateDealer :: a Reaktor23 Hackerspace Project
============================

MateDealer is an open source implementation of a MDB cashless device.
It runs on a Arduino Mega2560 and probably on other Arduinos/ATMEL micro processors.
Its written in c and not in the Arduino language. 

Note: The Arduino Mega2560 by default resets every time you connect to it via serial terminal.
