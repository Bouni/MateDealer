# MateDealer :: a Reaktor23 Hackerspace Project

## General
MateDealer is an open source implementation of a MDB cashless device.
It runs on a Arduino Mega2560 and probably on other Arduinos/ATMEL micro processors.
Its written in c and not in the Arduino language (c++). 

## Known problems
Note: The Arduino Mega2560 by default resets every time you connect to it via serial terminal.

## Setup

  1. Get the repo using `git clone git://github.com/Bouni/MateDealer.git`
  2. Compile it with `make all`
  3. Upload it to your Arduino with `make program`

## Requirements

  - AVR-GCC
  - AVRDUDE
  - avr-libc
