## arduino 
MateDealer is an open source implementation of a MDB cashless device.
It runs on a Arduino Mega2560 and probably on other Arduinos/ATMEL micro processors.
Its written in c and not in the Arduino c++ dialect. 

## webinterface
The webinterface will (when its working ;-) ) provide the GUI for the users, and the database with accounts and their balances.
It's build with [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) and several of it's extensions.
